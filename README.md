movie-search-android-application
================================

the Function is totally the same to that movie serach application project. you can search movies, share them on facebook.The only difference is that you do it on a android application.

The whole project is implemented in Java. The listView is implemented using the lazylist class from https://github.com/thest1/LazyList, which is a very popular post on stackoverflow.
